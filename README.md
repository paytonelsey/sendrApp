# Sendr Application
My final project for Intro to Android Development. An Android application that allows a user to make and edit an account then write letters to themselves to be delivered as notifications at the specified time and date.

The user has the option to add a subject line, a greeting, the body of the letter, a signature, the current device location (using a geo coding API), and/or upload a photo from the user's gallery. They are then propmpted with the option to select a date and time to deliver the letter to the device. The user is then greeted with a success screen with a summary of the letter.

### Known Bugs
- Keeping a user signed in
- Notification method does not work if phone is restarted
